================================================================================
Noticed a strong fuel smell near left rear tire. Turns out I had a cracked fuel filter. Ordered from Pelican and replaced myself. Not a bad job. Found out later on Rennlist that this was the subject of a recall!

Around same time, I replaced the fluid in the front and rear differentials. I used the recommended synthetic fluid; don''t recall the name. However, I do remember the fluid looked good in both. No evidence of metal shavings. The whine continued.
