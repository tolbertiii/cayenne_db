After returning from CAE one night, the air suspension compressor continued running after ignition turned off. I disconnected the battery overnight and the next day, it didn''t do exactly that but it did throw the "Air Suspension Faulty - Workshop" error that I have seen when the battery was weak.

I found Audi and VW posts mentioning this but nothing specifically for the 955. General advice seemed to be to replace the air suspension relay. It is found under the driver side dash. I replaced it today with one from O''Reily.
