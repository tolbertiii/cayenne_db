Got 5 new tires for the Cayenne! Graham''s did the work. These are BF Goodrich AT KO/2''s 265-65R18.

I also had to find 5 18 inch rims. I picked up 4 from a dude who met me in Concord. I think I gave him 500 for 4. Then I ordered one from eBay for 144.87.

I just need to get the car back from GAW so I can get these mounted.
