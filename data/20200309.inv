Oil change. Mobile 1 0w-40 European formula. 

I used an STP oil filter I got at AutoZone. It was a little sketchy looking, but seems to be ok. This was the time I split my thumb open when I wedged it between the filter housing and some damn piece of metal under there. I mean really, really cut the shit out of my thumb.
